1. **Clear description** of the feature
2. **Use case** - why is this needed?
3. **Proposed solution** (if you have one)
4. **Alternatives considered** (optional)

### Pull Requests

We actively welcome pull requests!

#### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
2. **Create an issue first** for major changes to discuss the approach
3. **Fork the repository** and create a branch from `main`

#### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/turbomcpstudio.git
cd turbomcpstudio

# Clone TurboMCP dependency
git clone https://github.com/Epistates/turbomcp.git ../turbomcp

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm run tauri dev
```

#### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch** with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Follow the code style**:
   - **Rust**: Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
   - **TypeScript**: Run `pnpm run check`
   - **Svelte 5**: Use runes mode (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props()`)

3. **Write clear commit messages**:
   ```
   feat: Add tool execution history
   fix: Resolve server connection timeout
   docs: Update installation instructions
   refactor: Simplify server store logic
   ```

   Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat:` New features
   - `fix:` Bug fixes
   - `docs:` Documentation changes
   - `style:` Code style changes (formatting)
   - `refactor:` Code refactoring
   - `test:` Test additions or changes
   - `chore:` Maintenance tasks

4. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run Rust tests
   cd src-tauri && cargo test

   # Run type checking
   pnpm run check

   # Test the app manually
   pnpm run tauri dev
   ```

5. **Update documentation** if needed:
   - Update README.md for user-facing changes
   - Add changelog entry for notable changes

#### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issue (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes
   - Test results if applicable

3. **Respond to feedback**:
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Push additional commits to the same branch
   - Request re-review when ready

#### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows the project's style guidelines

```

### Code Style

#### Svelte 5 (Runes Mode)

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct - Use runes
const { prop } = $props();
let count = $state(0);
const doubled = $derived(count * 2);

// ‚ùå Incorrect - Legacy syntax
export let prop;
let count = 0;
$: doubled = count * 2;
```

#### TypeScript

- Use strict type checking
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for objects
- Use meaningful variable names
- Document complex functions with JSDoc

#### Rust

- Follow Rust idioms and best practices
- Use `Result` and `Option` for error handling
- Document public APIs with doc comments
- Keep functions focused and testable

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for good test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Performance

- Profile before optimizing
- Use Svelte's reactivity efficiently
- Minimize expensive operations in hot paths
- Keep bundle sizes reasonable

//! Health Monitoring Module
//!
//! Provides comprehensive health and metrics monitoring for MCP connections:
//! - Per-connection metrics (requests, errors, uptime, response times)
//! - Aggregated metrics across all connections
//! - Real-time metric updates
//!
//! All methods are read-only and safe to call concurrently.
